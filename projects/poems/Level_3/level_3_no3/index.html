<div class="stanza-1">
  <p>My mother strokes the sand
  <p>toward her with her palm, drawing</p>
  <p>the story out, then levels it</p>
  <p>back with the edge of her hand.</p>

<br>
  <div class="stanza-2">
    <p>All the while
    <p>a ghost crab, half hidden</p>
    <p>under a canopy of crisped</p>
    <p>sargassum, so well-camouflaged</p>

<br>
  <div class="stanza-3">
    <p>it's just a blur of movement,
    <p>has been sliding in and out</p>
    <p>its tunnel, forming identical boulders</p>
    <p>of damp sand to stack</p>


<br>
  <div class="stanza-4">
    <p>at the entrance,
    <p>a bulwark. The story</p>
    <p>is a stone she collects</p>
    <p>from the titeline of the past.</p>

<br>
  <div class="stanza-5">
    <p>and returns it to her tongue,
    <p>a sparer truth: once she hid</p>
    <p>a pill bottle in her pocket,</p>
    <p>and what the shop owner's</p>

<br>
    <div class="stanza-6">
      <p>back was turned, pulled </p>
      <p>a mystery snail off the glass</p>
      <p>and dropped it into the vial</p>
      <p>of water, snapping down</p>

<br>
  <div class="stanza-7">
   <p>the lid. When her father</p>
   <p>saw it in her tank, he wrapped</p>
   <p>her braid around his fist</p>
   <p>and wrenched her off her feet.</p>

<br>
  <div class="stanza-8">
    <p>A new detail brightens</p>
    <p>the memory's</p>
    <p>aching chamber. He gave</p>
    <p>her aquarium away.</p>

<br>
  <div class="stanza-9">
    <p>When she loosens her fist</p>
    <p>to let fine sugar pour</p>
    <p>through the hourglass</p>
    <p>of her hand, the crab hunches</p>

<br>
  <div class="stanza-10">
    <p>sinking the picks of its legs</p>
    <p>in the sand. Its eye bulbs,</p>
    <p>lusterless as if dipped in black wax,</p>
    <p>fold inward in a cringe.</p>


<br>
  <div class="stanza-11">
    <p>A mind works this way, in secret</p>
    <p>tirelessly shaping, excavating</p>
    <p>a refuge for the tender self. A child</p>
    <p>steals the power she longs to have.</p>

    <br>
      <div class="stanza-11">
        <p>What's a snail's shell</p>
        <p>but a coiled tunnel</p>
        <p>What's the tough door</p>
        <p>but a body building no.</p>
