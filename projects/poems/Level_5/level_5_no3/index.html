    <p>My mother strokes the sand
    <br>toward her with her palm, drawing
  <br>
    the story out, then levels it
  <br>
    back with the edge of her hand.</p>

    <p>All the while <br>
    a ghost crab, half-hidden
  <br>
    under a canopy of crisped
  <br>
    sargassum, so well-camouflaged</p>

    <p>it's just a blur of movement <br>
    has been sidling in and out
  <br>
    its tunnel, forming identical boulders
  <br>
    of damp sand to stack</p>

    <p>at the entrance, <br>
    a bulwark. the story
  <br>
    is a stone she collects
  <br>
    from the tideline of the past</p>

    <p>For years it's arrived <br>
    again and again, as if something
  <br>
    draws it back
  <br>
    to her mind, tumbles it</p>

    <p>back was turned, pulled <br>
    a myster snail off the glass
  <br>
    and dropped it into the vial
  <br>
    of water, snapping down</p>


    <p>A new detail brightens <br>
    the memory's
  <br>
    aching chamber. He gave
  <br>
    her aquarium away</p>



    <p>When she loosens her first <br>
    to let fine sugar pour
  <br>
    through the hourglass
  <br>
    of her hand, the crab hunches,</p>

    <p>sinking the picks of its legs <br>
    in the sand. Its eye bulbs,
  <br>
    lusterless as if dipped in black wax,
  <br>
    fold inward in cringe.
    <p>What's a snail's shell <br>
    but a coiled tunnel.
  <br>
    What's the tough door
  <br>
    but a body building no.</p>
