<div class="line-1">
<p>MY MOTHER STROKES THE SAND &nbsp;&#9737; TORWARD HER WITH HER PALM, DRAWING&nbsp;&#9737; THE STORY OUT, THEN LEVELS IT &#9737; BACK WITH THE EDGE OF HER HAND &#9737;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-2">
<p>ALL THE WHILE &nbsp;&#10051; A GHOST CRAB, HALF-HIDDEN &nbsp;&#10051; UNDER A CANOPY OF CRISPED &#10051; SARGASSUM, SO WELL-CAMOUFLAGED &#10051;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-3">
<p>IT'S JUST A BLUR OF MOVEMENT, &#9872; HAS BEEN SLIDING IN AND OUT &nbsp;&#9872; ITS TUNNEL, FORMING IDENTICAL BOULDERS &#9872; OF DAMP SAND TO STACK &#9872;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-4">
<p>AT THE ENTRANCE, &#9787; A BULWARK. THE STORY &#9787; IS A STONE SHE COLLECTS &#9787; FROM THE TIDELINE OF THE PAST. &#9787;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-5">
<p>FOR YEARS IT'S ARRIVED &#10008; AGAIN AND AGAIN, AS IF SOMETHING &#10008; DRAWS IT BACK &#10008; TO HER MIND, TUMBLES IT, &#10008;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-6">
<p>AND RETURNS IT TO HER TONGUE, &#9993; A SPARER TRUTH: ONCE SHE HID &#9993; A PILL BOTTLE IN HER POCKET &#9993; TO HER AND WHEN THE SHOP OWNER'S &#9993;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-7">
<p>BACK WAS TURNED, PULLED &#9993; A MYSTERY SNAIL OFF THE GLASS &#9993; AND DROPPED IT INTO THE VIAL &#9993; OF WATER, SNAPPING DOWN &#9993;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-8">
<p>THE LID. WHEN HER FATHER &#10084; SAW IT IN HER TANK, WE WRAPPED &#10084; HER BRAID AROUND HIS FIST &#10084; AND WRENCHED HER OFF HER FEET &#10084;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-9">
<p>A NEW DETAIL BRIGHTENS &#10061; THE MEMORY'S &#10061; ACHING CHAMBER. HE GAVE &#10061; HER AQUARIUM AWAY &#10061;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-10">
<p>WHEN SHE LOOSENS HER FIST &#9999; TO LET FINE SUGAR POUR &#9999; THROUGH THE HOURGLASS &#9999; OF HER HAND, THE CRAB HUNCHES &#9999;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-11">
<p>SINKING THE PICKS OF ITS LEGS &#9986; IN THE SAND. ITS EYE BULBS, &#9986; LUSTER;ESS AS IF DIPPED IN BLACK WAX, &#9986; FOLD INWARD IN A CRINGE &#9986;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-12">
<p>A MIND WORKS THIS WAY, IN SECRET &#9861; TIRELESSLY SHAPING, EXCAVATING &#9861; A REFUGE FOR THE TENDER SELF. A CHILD &#9861; A CHILD STEALS THE POWER SHE LONGS TO HAVE &#9861;</p>
</div>

<div class="line-13">
<p>WHAT'S A SNAIL'S SHELL &#9729; BUT A COILED TUNNEL &#9729; WHAT'S THE TOUGH DOOR &#9729; BUT A BODY BUILDING NO. &#9729;</p>
</div>
