  <h1>The Web's Grain by Frank Chimero</h1>
    <h2><b>Highlights & Thoughts</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am not sure if I exactly feel warmth in my chest with the sound clip; more like anxous? More like a pouding in my chest? It may just be the coffee.</li>
      <li>Oh, its supposed to be irritating</li>
      <li>"The awe goes, time takes it," "We begin in admiration and end by organizing our disappointment" &#9785;</li>
      <li>"How can any self-aware person who works in technology <em>not</em> start to organize their disappointment" I somewhat feel this, especially since I've found that I love building websites/keeping up a social media. BUT, I prefer keeping from the perspective as extremely cold; not oversharing, etc. </li>
      <li>I like this idea of living in "contradiction," we think of this as a "no, no" and someone is not self-aware if they contradict themselves constantly. But, inherently, it is impossible to not. We should strive not to, but sometimes, "it be like that."</li>
      <li>Insteresting how a responsive website, #1 is a pain to make, but also; one day that website will no longer be responsive as technology advances</li>
      <li>"Its fascinating that you can do that, but it's not really what a website is supposed to do" I understand what he's sauing, but I also think super experimental, fragile, and easily breakable websites sound fufilling to make. But maybe I am still wide-eyed at the possibilities of web design.</li>
      <li>"clumsy sites that work counter to the inclinations of the web. Back to the zen koanâ€”if we see the mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers, these are the sites that try to be different, yet end up swimming up stream and climbing uphill."</li>
      <li>"What would happen if we stopped treating the web like a blank canvas to paint on, and instead like a material to build with?" Eh, I think it depends on the setting, or who this site is for. But I believe this is no fun. How can web design progress? Perhaps I am lumping it in with graphic design and the homogenization of it. I also think the writer is missing the mark; how can we distinguish ourselves in this world if we are not pursuing different solutions than our peers? We are blasted with design, day-to-day. I think the writer is edging on preference. I think you can still maintain web design principles but also push the boundary; otherwise we would just use website templates.</li>
      <li>But again, maybe I am doe-eyed and an idealistic - but I am also self-aware</li>
      <li>Aim for clarity, yes, but also aim for progression</li>
    </ul>
