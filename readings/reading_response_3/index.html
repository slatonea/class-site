  <h1>“Youth Mode: A Report of Freedom” K-HOLE & BOX 1824</h1>
    <h2><b>Highlights & Thoughts</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I was previously are of the “Net Art Anthology” while researching for another project. I came across “Youth Mode: A Report of Freedom”  which talks about the idea of “Normcore” being a form for freedom. It is a compiled in a PDF which I find interesting because I assume this it done for accessibility. </li>
      <li>MASS INDIE; we are not unique, it is pro-diversity but not post-scarcity</li>
      <li>There is a limited amount of different in the world, and the mainstreaming of “differences” has only made it scarcer.</li>
      <li>“Mass Indie is like talking about the dream you had last night, whereas Normcore is like talking about the weather. Both allow significant emotions to be revealed in casual settings. But no matter how vividly you describe it, your dream ends with you, while the coming storm affects us all.”<em> — K-HOLE and Box 1824 </em> </li>
      <li>The anxiety that there is no new terrain is always a catalyst for change**</li>
      <li>(I seem to believe this, especially growing up in an age where one can be their own boss, or make a living solely on the internet. I feel like all those jobs are taken or created already)</li>
      <li>Youth isn’t freedom in any political sense. It’s an emancipation from boredom, from prescription, from tradition. It’s the fullness of potential, the ability to be the person you want to be. It’s about the freedom to choose how you relate; the freedom to choose how you understand; the freedom to try new things; the freedom to make mistakes. Youth understands freedom with limits — that being adaptable is the only thing that will set you free.</li>
        <li>“Normcore moves away from a coolness that relies on difference to a post-authenticity coolness that opts in to sameness.</li>
    </ul>
