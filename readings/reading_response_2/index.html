  <h1>A Friend is Writing by Calum Copley</h1>
    <h2><b>Highlights & Thoughts</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Information overload; I feel anxious watching this, I canâ€™t keep up until I realized that the notificatons wouldnt disapear.</li>
      <li>In the realm of person-to-person interaction, however, the rules appear to change. Boredom is often replaced by anticipation.</li>
      <li>Both social and news media seek to appeal to and produce a sense that something important is just about to happen. (I agree!!!!)</li>
      <li>By exploiting anticipation and appealing to a sense of futurity, both intend to capture their audience for as long as possible.</li>
      <li><em>'If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold'.</em> (errie fact? Almost feel disposable)</li>
    </ul>
