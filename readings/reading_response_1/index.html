  <h1>JR Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h1>
    <h2><b>Highlights & Thoughts</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Handmade; webpages coded by hand rather than software</li>
      <li>"Handmade web// correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</li>
      <li>"DIY-aesthetics," I feel it has become a thing that people essentially strive for. Or, something I think sets them apart now. I think extremely clean, "adaptable" aesthetics are no longer fufilling designers</li>
      <li>Web as a slow, evergrowing platform.</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Laurel Scwults, My Website is a shifting house</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Technological friction and social pressures that come along with creating and maintaining a website it 2018</li>
      <li>In the age dominated by these platforms; no one is looking out for you, but you.. (depressing?)</li>
      <li>Not to limit yourself to only one website </li>
      <li>Duality of websites</li>
      <li>Both Subject and object at once</li>
      <li>What kind of room is a website?</li>
      <li>When you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity. (I remember wishing that I knew how to code so I can create my own portfolio website, I felt I could never conntect to premade ones. Maybe this is why I've been holding out on creating a new portfolio webiste...)</li>
      <li>Artist creating works; for themselves, then when they share their work for other</li>
      <li>Self-perfecting loops; creating the world, the rooms, and the architecture</li>
      <li>A website is always unfinished</li>
      <li><em>In the age of information overload, the ultimate luxury is meaning and context</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Hard science fiction vs short science fiction</li>
      <li>One does have any technology</li>
      <li>Technology is how society copes with physical reality</li>
      <li>Technology and “hi tech” are not synonymous; technology that is “hi” isn’t necessarily low</li>
      <li>Maybe the hard stuff is hidden like the bones, as opposed to an exoskeleton</li>
    </ul>
